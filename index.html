        <h3>Why is the Climate Changing?</h3>
        <p>Climate change is long-term shifts in the climate of earth. In the past 800,000 years, earth has 
            been through eight cycles of warm and cold periods, and the end of the most recent ice age, 
            11,700 years ago, was the dawn of human civilisation, as well as the start of the climate era
            that we experienced, up until humans started warming the earth more (“What is Climate [NASA]”).
        </p><p>The main reason for the changes in the climate are because of small changes in earth's orbit 
            (“Evidence”), but there are other reasons, such as change in the sun's activity or a major 
            volcanic eruption. However, We are now experiencing a period of Human-induced climate change,
            where humans are the main reason for the change in climate (“What is Climate [United Nations]”).
        <h3>How much is the Temperature Increasing?</h3>
        </p><p>The average temperature of earth has increased by around 1°C since pre-industrial times,
            and it is showing no signs of slowing down, with a 0.2°C increase per decade (“What is Climate [NASA]”).
