        <p>Climate change Causes all sorts of natural disasters, such as flooding.</p>
        <h3>Flooding</h3>
        <p>Although rivers have flooded before climate change, the frequency and severity of the floods have increased, and are expected to increase more. An example of a recent severe flood is in Ahrtal in Germany in 2021, where 188 people lost their lives.</p>

        <p>Pictures of the disaster can be seen below:</p>

        <h3>Droughts</h3>

        <p>Droughts are temporary water deficit in an area, and are caused by a lack of precipitation, and increased temperatures. They can stop crop growth, increase pest attacks, and increase wildfires.</p>

        <h3>Rising Sea Levels</h3>

        <p>Climate change also causes rising sea levels, which puts low-lying and island nations at risk. Additionally, it limits the availability of fresh water, as the sea can find its way into underground water tables and other fresh water sources.</p>

        <h3>Other Disasters</h3>

        <p>More severe storms (e.g. Hurricanes, Tornadoes, Thunderstorms) are also an effect of climate change, as it disrupts conventional weather systems.</p>
