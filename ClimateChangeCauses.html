    <h1>Causes of Climate Change</h1>

    

    <div id="text">
        <p>Human-induced climate change is caused by the human emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.</p>
        <h3>What are greenhouse gasses?</h3>
        <p>There are four major Greenhouse gasses that are directly emitted by humans, and these are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour, and chlorofluorocarbons (“Causes”).</p>
    
        <p> When these greenhouse gasses are emitted, they stay in the upper atmosphere. When the sun’s energy hits the surface of the earth, it is reflected up into the atmosphere. If it were not for greenhouse gasses, the energy would travel all the way to space. However, the greenhouse gasses absorb most of this heat, and give it off slowly (“Causes”). Greenhouse gasses are a net good for us, as if our atmosphere did not contain them, then the global average temperature could be as low as -18°C, which is a big drop from 14°C (“The Greenhouse”).</p>

        <p> All of the greenhouse gasses (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour, chlorofluorocarbons), except for chlorofluorocarbons, are naturally occurring, but the problem we are having now is that because humans are also emitting them, the levels of greenhouse gasses are too high, and hence, we are experiencing a warming trend.</p>
        <h3>Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h3>
        <p>Here is a graph that shows what sectors of human production and consumption emit the most carbon dioxide, which is the most prevailant greenhouse gas:</p>
